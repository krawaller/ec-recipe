     *         (You will need to move the declaration so that it's above your code.)
     *
     *  - The `id` property should be used both in the link and the image.
     *  - The `name` property is for the <h2> heading
     *  - The `lead` property is -- you guessed it -- for the paragraph with the "lead" class
     *  - The `rating` is the trickiest; you'll want one `for` loop making filled glyphicon-star,
     *    and another making glyphicon-star-empty... for a total of 5 stars.
